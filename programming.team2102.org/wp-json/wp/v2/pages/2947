You should pass in the desired ball count in the constructor and if that count is set to zero, have it shoot an infinite number of balls. This mode can be used when manually shooting. Later when you are shooting autonomously, you can specify the count. You may also want to include a parameter which specifies whether or not to reset the counter at the beginning of the command.
