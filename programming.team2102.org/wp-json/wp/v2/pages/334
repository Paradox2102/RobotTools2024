There are several reasons for this. The first is that the Linux operating system that runs on the Raspberry Pi isn\u2019t that that well suited to controlling low level hardware (there is only one hardware PWM pin for example). In addition if we use an Arduino, we will have access to a very large library of code which can control any number of devices and sensors. This code is all written in&nbsp;<strong>C++<\/strong>&nbsp;and would probably be difficult to port to the Raspberry Pi, especially since we are using Java.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The communications between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi is done via the serial ports on both and a very simple ascii protocol is used.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This topic will walk you through the process of building the robot used for the&nbsp;Robot Java&nbsp;tutorials.
