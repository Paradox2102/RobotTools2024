I considered creating some kind of simulator, but it seemed to me that getting the student to work with an actual robot would be more appealing. However, I needed a robot that was inexpensive enough that each student could have their own robot. Eight years ago there was no inexpensive suitable robot available, as robots such as the <strong>XRP <\/strong>did not exist, so I created one myself. My first version used an Arduino which connected to the laptop via <strong>bluetooth<\/strong>. At the time, the team was using <strong>C++<\/strong> to program their robots and an <strong>Arduino <\/strong>was sufficient to meet the needs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the team decided to switch to <strong>Java <\/strong>and I needed something with more horsepower than the <strong>Arduino <\/strong>could supply. Fortunately, at the time, the <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero<\/strong> was released. This I coupled with an <strong>Arduino <\/strong>to create a robot that could run <strong>Java <\/strong>and connect via <strong>WiFi<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I created the <a href=\"http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/robot-java\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"23\">Minibot Tutorial<\/a> that works with this robot. The purpose of the tutorial was to familiarize the student with the basics of <strong>FRC <\/strong>programming. The student learns how to create <strong>Subsystems <\/strong>and <strong>Commands <\/strong>and how to combine commands. The motors have <strong>quadrature <\/strong>encoders so the student also learns how to control a motor&#8217;s speed using <strong>PID<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Nerfbot<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/NerfBot-994x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3637\" width=\"402\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/NerfBot-994x1024.jpg 994w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/NerfBot-291x300.jpg 291w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/NerfBot-150x155.jpg 150w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/NerfBot-768x791.jpg 768w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/NerfBot.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This simple robot worked quite well with the basics but I found that it was not quite sufficient to prepare the student for the more complex robots that the team creates. So I decided to create a second robot with more functionality. This robot, called the <strong>Nerfbot<\/strong>, added a <strong>turret <\/strong>upon which a <strong>nerf ball shooter<\/strong> was mounted. The robot also had a <strong>camera <\/strong>which used reflective tape to allow for <strong>target tracking<\/strong>. In addition there was a <strong>gyro <\/strong>which allowed for the creation of precise autonomous paths. Because of the increased requirements, I moved from using an Arduino to using a 32 bit microcontroller known as the <strong>&#8220;Blue Pill&#8221;<\/strong>. I also moved from a <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero<\/strong> to a <strong>Raspberry Pi 3<\/strong>. The <a href=\"http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/nerfbot\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"252\">Nerfbot Tutorial<\/a> was able to teach all of these concepts which better prepared the student for working on a full <strong>FRC <\/strong>robot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SwerveBot<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/SwerveBot-908x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3635\" width=\"391\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/SwerveBot-908x1024.jpg 908w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/SwerveBot-266x300.jpg 266w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/SwerveBot-150x169.jpg 150w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/SwerveBot-768x866.jpg 768w, http:\/\/programming.team2102.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/SwerveBot.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This all worked quite well, but as time progressed, the team made the move to using a swerve drive chassis and replaced the reflective tape vision with <strong>Apriltags<\/strong>. This effectively rendered the <strong>Nerfbot <\/strong>obsolete. So we have created a new robot based on a <strong>swerve drive<\/strong>. The <strong>nerf ball shooter<\/strong> is mounted on top (the turret was removed as it was a bit redundant). There is a camera which processes <strong>Apriltags <\/strong>and path following using the popular <strong>Path Planner<\/strong> is implemented. Due to the increased requirements this new robot needed to use two of the <strong>&#8220;Blue Pill&#8221;<\/strong> microcontrollers and an <strong>Raspberry Pi 4<\/strong>.
